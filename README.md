# Amazon Automation Bot

This project consists of **two Python scripts** that automate the process of searching for a product on Amazon India and adding it to the cart using Selenium.

## üìå Project Overview

1. **amazon_bot.py** ‚Äì Searches for a product and attempts to add it to the cart **without logging in**.
2. **amazon_automation_bot_after_login** ‚Äì Logs into an Amazon account before searching for a product and adding it to the cart.

These scripts use **Selenium WebDriver** to interact with Amazon's website, mimicking human actions like searching for a product, selecting an item, and adding it to the cart.
